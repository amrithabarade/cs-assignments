
Assignment-2
===========

This project contains java code to take in different attributes (like height, weight, marks etc) of a student and provide comments on various aspects like whether the student is short, 
or has to improve in his/her studies etc.

The classes written below are used to demonstrate various key priciples of Object Oriented Programming in Java listed below:

1) Inheritance (child class stuaca inherits from parent class student and adds its own variables)

2) Interface (there are two interfaces named A and B that implements two different sets of methods)

2) Usage of constructors (constructor is used to initialize the registration number of the student)

3) Overloading of methods (super keyword is used to call the parent class method)

4) Usage of static and final variables (variables hc and wg which hold the feet and grams multipliers. Final so that they cannot be changed further. Static so that they are availabe without instantiation)

PROGRAM OUTPUT:

 The name of the student is Amritha Barade 

 The registration number of the student is 12345

 Now let us look at the diffent attributes of the student 

 Enter the height of the student in terms of feet and inches: 

5
6

 The height of the student is: 165

 The student is tall. 
 
 
 Enter the weight of the student in kilos: 

65

 The weight of the student in grams is: 65000

 The student is overweight. 


 Enter marks for the student in 3 subjects (0 to 100):
90
95
92

 Total of marks in all 3 subjects is: 
277
 This is a dummy try block to demonstrate try-catch functionality



 The student is a good student
